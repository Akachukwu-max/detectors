sweet Jesus
You’re the wind beneath my wings
Sweet Jesus
You’re my Melody and harmony
Sweet Jesus
You’re the eyes that I see through
Sweet Jesus
Yes am dancing to your tune
For as the dear pants for water so
my soul longs for you
Forever and ever, yes
this heart beats for you
As the deer pants for water so
My soul longs for you
Forever and ever, yes
This heart beats for you
Something more than gold
I’ve got something more than gold
Something more than gold
I’ve got something more than gold
If all I’ve got is Jesus, I’ve got something more than gold
I’ll tell it to the world
Jesus is more than gold
More than gold more than gold
I’ve got something more than gold
I’ll tell it to this world
Jesus is more than gold
It’s such an honor that you called me your own
Your love is unchangeable
Keeps coming after me
Shepherd of my heart
I love how you love me
Treasure of my soul
I stand in awe of you
As the deer pants for water so
My soul longs for you
Forever and ever, yes
This heart beats for you
As the deer pants for water so
My soul longs for you (jesus)
Forever and ever, yes
This heart beats for you
Something more than gold
I’ve got something more than gold
Something more than gold
I’ve got something more than gold
If all I’ve got is Jesus
I’ve got something more than gold
I’ll scream it to the world now
Jesus is more than gold
More than gold, more than gold
I’ve got something more than gold
Jesus you are more than gold
Ah ah ah
Nothing else matters but you
Jesus is more than gold
Jesus you are more than gold
I have you, I have everything
Jesus is more than gold
More than what money can buy
More than what the world will give
More than everything to me
Jesus you mean so much more to me
I’ve got something more than gold
If all I’ve got is you
You are more than gold
You’re more than gold
As the deer pants for water so,
My soul longs for you
Forever and ever, yes
This heart beats for you
